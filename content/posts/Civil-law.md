## Legal Principles of Civil Law in Pakistan
The legal principles governing civil law in Pakistan are based on a combination of Islamic law and common law principles. The Constitution of Pakistan guarantees the protection of individual rights, including the right to due process and access to justice. The civil justice system in Pakistan is based on the adversarial system, in which parties to a dispute present their cases to a judge, who then makes a decision based on the evidence presented.
